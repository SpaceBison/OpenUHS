About

  This is an open source parser library for Universal Hint System files. They're meant to be opened by a reader, a game assistant that gradually reveals hints/images in a non-linear FAQ-like manner rather than spoiling everything as a walkthrough would. Over 500 games are known to the UHS repository.

  The core features are all here: sections, text, hints, clickable images, links, and sounds. It can decrypt all hints from current UHS files (88a-96a, something no previous unofficial readers could do), but it safely ignores parts it doesn't recognize yet.
